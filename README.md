# CSharpPath
This repository contains learning projects from C# beginner to expert. 

C# is the most popular language to build .NET applications today. Itâ€™s part of the .NET ecosystem, which offers developers all the tools, languages and frameworks to create all types of applications including web, cloud, desktop, AI and mobile.

C# 12, is the version used in these projects. However, most concepts that I have used in these projects apply to earlier versions too.

We use Heavenly Scents Aromatherapy online shop (https://www.heavenlyscentsaromatherapy.com.au/) as our use case.
